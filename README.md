# Advanced Image Processing Lab

## Overview
This project is a collection of labs in advanced image processing that I completed during my university days. Each lab's explanations and questions can be found inside the "Labs_pdf" folder.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following:
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- Python version 3.8 or higher

## Environment Setup
You can initialize the required environment by following these steps:
1. Navigate to the "Lab_01" folder.
2. Use [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) to create the environment using the provided "environment.yaml" file.

## Note
Originally, these labs were designed to be completed using MATLAB. However, we obtained permission from the professor to implement them in Python instead.

## Status
This project is archived.

## Important
Please note that the final lab project was done in MATLAB, and the paper is written in Hebrew.

Feel free to explore the labs and learn more about advanced image processing. If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out.
